Here is an example of how to mount a Google Drive to your Colab notebook and then run a python script on a csv file from your Drive:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Import pandas library
import pandas as pd

# Read the csv file from your Drive
df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/laptop_pricing_dataset_mod2.csv')

# Perform some operations on the csv file
print(df.head())




# Download the CSV file to your Colab environment questo e' giusto
from google.colab import files

uploaded = files.upload()

# Assuming the CSV file is named "laptop_pricing_dataset_mod2.csv", read it using pandas
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('laptop_pricing_dataset_mod2.csv')

# Print the first few rows of the DataFrame
df.shape



Here is an example of how to write a python script to read the csv file from a URL:

import pandas as pd

# Read the csv file from the URL
url = 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Data%20files/module_5_auto.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Perform some operations on the csv file
print(df.head())
